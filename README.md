Project Objective:

Heart disease is one of the complex diseases and globally many people suffered from this disease. It is even being highlighted as a silent killer which leads to death of a person without obvious symptoms. On time and efficient identification of heart disease plays a key role in healthcare, particularly in the field of cardiology. Utilization of suitable technology support in this regard can prove to be highly beneficial to the medical fraternity and patients. This issue can be resolved by adopting Data Science techniques. This projects intends to adopt Naive Bayes algorithm to design a classification model for the effective identification of Heart disease. This Naive Bayes model will predict whether the patient will have the risk heart disease or not.

Implimentation:

Gathered pertinent medical datasets of heart disease patients and performed data preprocessing tasks, 
including data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values, ensuring data quality.
Implemented Naive Bayes algorithm in R programming for classification, utilizing statistical probabilities to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient data.
Made use of data visualization libraries in R to create informative charts and graphs.
